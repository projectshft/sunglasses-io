## Sunglasses.io Server Starter
You can start this server multiple ways. You can start it throught the vscode debugger. Also in your command line you can type in: 
node app/server.js   
this will start the server up.

Only the backend is complete. There is currently not a working client side available.

Please do an npm install. I added some npm installs that were not native to the original sunglasses-io node-modules
npm install should do the trick 

two NPMs that i installed are
npm install express
npm install parseurl
