## Sunglasses.io Server Starter
You can start this server multiple ways. You can start it throught the vscode debugger. Also in your command line you can type in: 
node app/server.js   
this will start the server up.

Only the backend is complete. There is currently not a working client side available.

Please do an npm install.

Also the sunglasses.yaml file can be pasted into the swagger editor to utilize it for examples.
